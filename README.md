# SONIC

After reading the research paper ["A Volumetric Display for Visual, Tactile and Audio presentation using Acoustic Trapping"](../blob/main/references/A Volumetric Display.pdf), I decided I wanted to learn more about acoustics. This repository currently holds the simulation program I implemented following the paper, and will eventually hold the software and PCB layout for the physical device that will levitate a styrofoam ball.

The [simulation](/tree/main/simulation) folder contains outputs for 2D and 3D representations of the wave.

2D example:
